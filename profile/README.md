# Tadesse Lab

### Diagnostics Anywhere 

Rapid, accurate disease diagnosis, and real-time monitoring is essential for effective treatments, halting the rise of drug resistance, and achieving personalized health and precision medicine goals. The Tadesse Lab develops next generation point-of-care diagnostic devices using optical, spectroscopy and nanoscience-based tools with machine learning based data analysis for application in resource limited clinical settings including developing nations, extraterrestrial exploration, and military sites. We aim to establish a leading research program for translational medicine integrating sensing technologies, artificial intelligence tools and needs-based design thinking for translation to targeted clinical and research settings.
